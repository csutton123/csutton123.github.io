					<h4>The Great Tech Project</h4>
					<p><em>August 2016 - Current</em></p><br>
					<p><span class='titles'>Title</span>: Web Developer, Sole Proprietor</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I do here</span>: I build websites for small businesses. Technologies include: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery &amp; AngularJS. Clients include: restaurants, real estate agents, accountants, tailors, event planners, &amp; more.</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I've learned</span>: The most important thing I'm learning is best practices for web development. I am truly honing my skills here. I'm learning new techniques with every single project. There are TONS of reasons people need websites. Deliver what the client wants and not necessarily what you feel they should have. In web design, you are not just a web designer, you are also a business consultant. I was also forced to learn a bit of photoshop, or in my case, Gimp.</p>

					<h4>Fabl</h4>
					<p><em>December 2015 - Current</em></p><br>
					<p><span class='titles'>Title</span>: Director of Sales &amp; Business Development</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I do here</span>: I'm responsible for all things Sales. I cold call to get new leads, answer inbound registrations, perform demos via UberConference, coordinate lead gen campaigns, and make changes based on company direction. Fabl is a small marketing technology startup based in Durham, NC. We sell annual subscriptions to our platform for $30k - $100k. Notable clients: CBS, Ducati, Forbes, Cnet, SXSW.</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I've learned</span>: You MUST be comfortable wearing multiple hats daily. That's how I learned a lot about Marketing. Communication and efficiency is SUPER important. Each aspect of the company affects every other aspect of the company in some way. DO NOT be afraid to make mistakes. Be afraid to not learn from them. Either way mistakes will happen. Learn indefinitely. It should be a never ending process. Seek help and guidance from those more skilled than you. It will make you better. Most of all, startups are awesome! Challenging, but AWESOME!</p>

					<h4>Citrix ShareFile</h4>
					<p><em>April 2013 - December 2015</em></p><br>
					<p><span class='titles'>Title</span>: Senior Inside Sales Executive</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I did there</span>: Closed monthly, quarterly, and annual subscriptions to ShareFile's platform to Small and Medium sized businesses. Average quarterly deal size: $500. Started as Lead Generation Rep making 150 cold calls per day. A series of promotions led me to my last role, managing the entire sales process: Cold calling to set demos, performing demos for C-suite executives, and closing business against a $2700 monthly sales quota. I was consistently 110 - 125% over quota.</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I've learned</span>: This is where I truly learned the art of sales. It was the first time I had to hustle hard mentally. I learned the process and psychology of sales. It's the first time I was required to actually research and study the sales process if I wanted to succeed. I learned how to take control of a sales call. I learned SPIN Selling, SNAP Selling, and The Challenger Sale. I also read The Lean Startup. It was very different than anything I thought I knew about sales previously. I learned how to start from nothing and build my own book of business. This is where I became an expert. Believe it or not, I also learned a lot about myself and life in general here.</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>Why I left</span>: In short: Change. Now, there's nothing wrong with change and I completely understand that change is part of life. As a matter of fact, over the years I have practiced how to handle change when I don't want change to happen or when change is unexpected, and feel I am better at dealing with it than most people. However this change was different. This time I felt like the company was changing and growing, but I wasn't changing or growing with it. I was with ShareFile as a startup, all the way through full acquisition. Plenty of things changed, but as someone who wanted to continue to learn and practice the art of sales rather than move into management or some other department, I felt overlooked. I felt as if I had stopped learning and growing. From there, I developed the itch to take what I had learned and challenge myself at a small startup.</p>

					<h4>CarMax</h4>
					<p><em>April 2006 - August 2010</em></p><br>
					<p><span class='titles'>Title</span>: Sales Consultant</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I did there</span>: I sold plenty of cars. I think the monthly quota was 12 cars. At regular dealerships the quota is like 7 or something. I'm pretty sure you can imagine what the life of a car salesman is like. Very long hours, test drives, negotiations, etc. I won a few sales awards and I was in the highest ranking sales club.</p>
					<p><span class='titles'>What I've learned</span>: This was my first true sales job. And boy oh boy was it a rude awakening. This was my first taste of how to hustle. Long hours and late nights included. I had to learn things on the fly. Before this job, everything I had done previously was basically customer service. Here, I learned the power of asking questions to learn a customers' needs and not just trying to force my own agenda down their throats. This came with LOTS of trial and error. I also truly learned how to handle rejection. It was a very humbling experience. I came to realize that even though I thought I was a special person, to customers, I was just a sales guy. There's plenty more I learned here, but I'll spare you.</p>
					<p><strong>Why I left</strong>: Selling cars was cool and all, and I don't regret getting my start there because I learned a ton, but selling cars was just not the long game for me. I wanted to be more than just a car salesman.</p>
